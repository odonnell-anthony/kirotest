# Wiki Documentation App

A high-performance Python-based wiki/documentation application with PostgreSQL backend, Redis caching, and server-side rendering.

## Features

- FastAPI-based REST API with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- PostgreSQL database with full-text search capabilities
- Redis for caching and session management
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Health check endpoints for container orchestration
- Background task processing with Celery

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory

2. Copy the environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Update the `.env` file with your configuration values

4. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. The application will be available at:
   - Main app: http://localhost:8000
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
   - Health check: http://localhost:8000/health

### Production Deployment

1. Copy and configure production environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.prod
   # Edit .env.prod with production values
   ```

2. Deploy with production compose file:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d
   ```

## Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

- **API Layer**: FastAPI routers and endpoints
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and operations
- **Data Layer**: SQLAlchemy models and database operations
- **Infrastructure**: Database, Redis, logging, and configuration

## Development

### Local Development

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
black app/
isort app/

# Lint code
flake8 app/
mypy app/
```

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. See `.env.example` for all available options.

Key configuration areas:
- Database connection settings
- Redis connection settings
- Security keys and tokens
- File upload settings
- Logging configuration

## Health Checks

The application provides several health check endpoints:

- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/health/detailed` - Detailed health check with database and Redis status
- `/health/ready` - Readiness check for orchestration
- `/health/live` - Liveness check for orchestration

## Logging

The application uses structured JSON logging with correlation IDs for request tracing. Logs are written to both console and file outputs.

## Security

- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS protection
- Security headers

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code style and patterns
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Ensure all health checks pass
