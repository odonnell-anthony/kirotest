# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Python-based wiki/documentation application with PostgreSQL backend and server-side rendered frontend. The application focuses on high-performance search capabilities with autocomplete functionality, supports user authentication with bearer tokens, role-based access (admin/normal users), and provides advanced content management including folders, draft/published states, commenting, and direct linking to specific content sections.
